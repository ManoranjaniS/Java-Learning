# Recursion in Java ðŸ”„

This section contains Java programs demonstrating **Recursion**, a fundamental concept in problem-solving, dynamic programming, and algorithmic challenges.

## ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¢ Basic Recursion
âœ… Factorial of a number  
âœ… Fibonacci series  
âœ… Sum of digits of a number  
âœ… Reverse a number  

### ðŸ”„ Advanced Recursion  
âœ… Check if a string is a palindrome using recursion  
âœ… Find the Nth Fibonacci number using memoization  
âœ… Solve the Tower of Hanoi problem  

### ðŸŒ€ Backtracking Problems  
âœ… Generating all subsets of a set  
âœ… Finding all permutations of a string/array  
âœ… Solving the N-Queens problem  
âœ… Sudoku solver  

Recursion helps in breaking down problems into smaller subproblems and is widely used in **divide and conquer** techniques.
