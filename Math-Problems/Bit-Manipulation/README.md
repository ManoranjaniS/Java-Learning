Bit Manipulation in Java âš¡
This section contains Java programs that demonstrate efficient bitwise operations, a powerful technique used in algorithm optimization, cryptography, and low-level programming.

ðŸ“Œ Topics Covered
ðŸ”¢ Basic Bitwise Operations
âœ… Bitwise AND (&) â€“ Checking even/odd numbers
âœ… Bitwise OR (|) â€“ Setting specific bits
âœ… Bitwise XOR (^) â€“ Finding unique elements
âœ… Bitwise NOT (~) â€“ Flipping bits

ðŸ”„ Bit Shifting Techniques
âœ… Left Shift (<<) â€“ Multiplying by powers of 2
âœ… Right Shift (>>) â€“ Dividing by powers of 2
âœ… Unsigned Right Shift (>>>) â€“ Handling unsigned numbers

ðŸ›  Advanced Bit Manipulation
âœ… Checking if a number is a power of 2
âœ… Counting set bits in a number
âœ… Finding the only non-repeating element in an array (XOR Trick)
âœ… Swapping two numbers without a temporary variable
